Database Development

This project, developed as part of my IS 475: Database Design & Management course, is a comprehensive SQL-based supply chain and inventory management system. It simulates a real-world business scenario where organizations manage work orders, purchase orders, vendors, invoices, and product inventory.

The database is designed to track order fulfillment, product lifecycle, vendor pricing trends, and employee efficiency using optimized SQL queries and views.

Technologies Used
SQL Server – Database schema design, indexing, and query optimization.
SQL Queries & Views – Aggregate functions, joins, and reporting views.
Normalization & Optimization – Efficient data retrieval and reporting.
